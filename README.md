This is a project of an end-to-end music artist recommendation engine with a frontend that users can interact with. Users enter the name of an artist and receives
recommendations of similar artists. The recommendations are made based mainly on artist genre. 

All the data in this project was scraped from sites such as billboard.com, genius.com and spotify. All code and requirements to successfully run this engine are contained
